## test coercion of optmatch to matrix.csr:
## - gives proper mean diffs w/ matched pairs
## - gives proper mean diffs w/ matches w/ mult controls
## - gives proper mean diffs w/ matches w/ varying num controls
## - gives mean diffs of 0 for matched sets w/ no tx or no ctl
## - associates levels(from)[i] with row i of result
